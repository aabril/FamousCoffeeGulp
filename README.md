# Famo.us Coffee Gulp Project Template
A starter project for the [Famo.us](http://famo.us) frontend framework. 

It uses [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) and for running the tests [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) using [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) with the [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) assertion library and [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) for spies and mocking.

The build process is done with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and has a nice livereload dev server.

## Getting started

0. Install the Node dependencies: ```npm install```
0. Install the Bower dependencies: ```bower install```
0. Start the Karma test runner ```npm test``` or directly with ```karma start test/karma.config.coffee``` (you need to have the Karma-cli installed globally first with ```npm install -g karma-cli```)
0. Start the dev server in a new terminal window ```npm start``` or just ```gulp```
